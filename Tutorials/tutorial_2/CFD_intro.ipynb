This is due to the assumption `old_step = current_step.copy()`, which means the wave has zero velocity before the start of the simulation. Therefore, the energy stored in the system (for example, due to the tension of a deformated string) is equally split in the two directions to conserve the total momentum (which is zero since the initial velocity is zero). This is not at all absurd. In fact, this is what happens when we pluck a guitar string. You can also see that when one of these waves (the left one) reaches the end of the string it is reflected back, but its ampliude is inverted! This is a well-known phenomenon in wave theory."

To see that, we have to drop the assumption of zero initial velocity (which conflicts with the functional form assumed here), and instead realise that in a time step of the simulation, the wave travels by $\\mathrm{d} x = c \\Delta t$ (notice how $\\mathrm{d} x$ is **not** the same as $\\Delta x$). By remembering the definition of the parameter $r$ we can write $\\mathrm{d} x = c \\Delta t = r \\Delta x$. In our example, we have (somewhat implicitly) assumed that $\\Delta x = 1$ and chosen $r=1$, therefore $\\mathrm{d} x = 1$. This means that in the timestep before the beginning of the simulation, the Gaussian deformation was centered at $x_c - \\mathrm{d} x = x_c - 1$. We can then set up these new initial conditions and perform the simulation again."

        "Imagine that $c \\Delta t > \\Delta x$ (i.e. $r>1$). In this case, within a single time step $\\Delta t$, the information carried by the wave (for example the distortion of the string) crosses an entire resolution element. But our algorithm can only communicate information between _adjacent_ resolution elements. In other words, the resolution element that is completely traversed by the wave will never \"realize\" that something happened! So when we will try to perform another step forward in the simulation, this element will have the wrong value, compromising the results of its neighbors. The step afterward, the pollution will propagate to the neighbors of its neighbors, and so on... Therefore, we must choose a value of $r \\leq 1$.\n",

For example, if we are simulating how sound propagates in the air, we still have to satisfy the condition $r\\leq1$, now using the speed of sound as $c$. This is a fundamental principle used in virtually all simulations of gas dynamics, from the internal working of a fridge to the evolution of the Universe. If you have multiple types of waves traveling in the system simulated (for instance sound waves and gravity waves), $c$ has to be the *largest* among the wave speeds.\n",
